# Working Title(a working title)

Welcome to *Working Title*, a game where the player explores an unfinished game. Explore the world and try to discover what seems to be wrong.

## Build
- Javascript
- CSS
- React
- Redux

I used React to make different components which would make it easy to manage what I want on the screen and allow me to use similarly structured items such as characters and map tiles, while still allowing them to be different in some ways.
